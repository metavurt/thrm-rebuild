                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>The gases will not separate in the pipeline downstream of the gas mixer. Once gases are mixed in
                        the mixing system they will continue to be mixed. Gases remain mixed because the gas molecules
                        move around at high speed, causing collisions that keep the gases mixed. Because of this
                        property, there is no limit to the length of a mixed gas pipeline in regards to mixed gas
                        stratification.</p>

                        gas mixer?</span></summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>When cylinders are filled it is typical to initiate filling with one gas constituent and topping
                        off the cylinder with the remaining gas constituents. Therefore there is stratification at the
                        time of cylinder filling. This problem can be corrected by using a dip tube inside the cylinder
                        or rolling the cylinder after filling. When gases are mixed in a Thermco gas mixer, the gas
                        constituents flow together at right angles, causing turbulence at the mixing point. This
                        creates a homogenous mixture. The gases remain mixed after this point in the mixing process.</p>

                        using flow meters?</span></summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>Flow meter accuracy is subject to many variables, including pressure, temperature and the
                        physical characteristics of each gas, such as specific gravity. Rotometer type flow meters are
                        especially likely to yield inaccurate readings because the gas in the flow meter tube is not at
                        the pressure or temperature the tube was designed for. The Thermco gas mixer with a gas
                        analyzer yields a result that is more accurate than all but the most accurate flow meters.</p>

                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>The gas pressures into the Thermco gas mixer do not have to be equal. There is an inlet pressure
                        envelope that is specified for each gas mixer. The standard inlet pressure for Thermco gas
                        mixers is 100-125 PSIG (6.9-8.6 BARG). The user should maintain the inlet pressures within the
                        specified range in order for the gas mixer to meet its accuracy specification.</p>

            <details>
                <summary><span>How do I determine the correct size of gas mixer for welding shield gas applications?</span></summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>The total required flow rate will depend upon several factors. These include the number of
                        welders, shield gas flow per welder and the “on” time for the welders (duty cycle). The gas
                        mixer should be sized to be able to supply the peak flow of shield gas required. For example,
                        if a user has 50 welding stations and each station uses shield gas at 35 SCFH, the potential
                        flow rate is 50 x 35 = 1750 SCFH. If the welders are “on” for 50% of the time, the required
                        usage is 1750 x .5= 875 SCFH. Some safety margin should always be considered. At times more
                        than 50% of the welders may be welding, and some welders may turn up the flow on their flow
                        meters. Also, robotic welders may use a greater flow rate than manual welders. In the above
                        example, if a safety margin of 25% is desired, the needed flow rate would be 875 x 1.25=1093.25
                        SCFH.

                        Standard Thermco gas mixers are available in increments of 750, 2000, 5000 and 10000 SCFH. In
                        this case the correct choice would be the 2000 SCFH model.

                <summary><span>Can I use a Thermco thermal conductivity gas analyzer to measure a 3 part gas mixture?</span></summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>Gas analyzers based on the thermal conductivity principle use the thermal conductivity
                        properties of gases to analyze gas mixtures. Different gases have different thermal
                        conductivities. When measuring a two gas mixture, the thermal conductivity of the mixture can
                        be compared to the thermal conductivity of a pure gas, usually the base gas in the mixture such
                        as nitrogen or argon. By experimentation the output of the thermal conductivity detector can be
                        determined for various two gas mixtures; this data is input into a linearizer that produces a
                        linear signal proportional to the gas mixture %. If three or more gases are in the mixture it
                        is unpredictable what combination of the three gases is creating the output from the thermal
                        conductivity cell. Therefore this technique is normally used only for two gas mixtures.</p>

                    <p>The only three gas mixture that Thermco measures using thermal conductivity is the CO2/O2/Ar
                        mixture if the user has an independent method of measuring the O2. Consult with Thermco for
                        more details.</p>

                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>When gas mixers are manufactured for food service, all the wetted surfaces are cleaned to remove

                        eventually contaminate food being packaged. Also, thread sealants and lubricants are used that

                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>Only gas mixers manufactured for oxygen service can be used in oxygen service. Because the
                        amount of cleaning and changes in materials required, Thermco does not recommend attempting to
                        convert a non-oxygen service gas mixer to an oxygen service gas mixer.</p>

                    <p>Since oxygen service parts, thread sealants and lubricants can be used with most non-oxygen
                        gases, it may be possible to convert an oxygen service gas mixer to non-oxygen service. Older
                        gas mixers may be uneconomical to convert. Consult Thermco for details.</p>

                    <p>Many spare parts are stocked by Thermco, but the best practice is to have the recommended spare
                        parts on hand to prevent a prolonged shutdown. For special gas mixing systems (examples are
                        high pressure or high flow) some parts are not stocked by Thermco and may have lead times of
                        several weeks. In these cases it is very important for the user to stock the recommended spare

                        a Thermco gas mixer or analyzer is 15 years. At a certain age replacement of a gas mixer or
                        analyzer with a new unit will be more economical than the cost of repairing an old unit,
